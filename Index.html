            <p class="p">&emsp;Hi, I'm Will and I'm a 15 year old sophomore who goes to Summit Rainier Public School. I was born in Faifax County Virginia. I lived in Wasington DC for most of my early childhood, except for fouth grade, when I went to live with my family in Romania for a year. There, I lived with my grandparents, aunt, and cousins. The next year, I came back to the U.S. In 5th grade, my dad got a job offer in California, so we moved to San Jose. In 8th grade, I went to Romania for another year. I learned a lot of math so when I came back in 9th grade, I was placed in math II.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Traveling</h1>
        <p class="p">&emsp;I have been to over 16 countries. I visit my family in Romania almost every summer, and we often visit other nearby countries. For 1 night, I stayed at a hotel in Istanbul, by myself. I was flying back to the U.S. after visiting Romania, and had 2 flights: one from Bucharest, Romania to Istanbul, Turkey, and another from Istanbul home, in San Jose. My first flight left 20 minutes late, and I only had 1 hour inbetween flights. By the time I got through security, my other flight left without me. The airline I was flying with gave me a new flight the next day (for free), and payed for food, transportation, and a hotel. I left the next day, and got home that night.<br><img src="Kensonisascrub.png" width=500px></img></p>
        <h1 class="title">Favourites</h1>
        <p class="p">&emsp;My favourite restaurant is Cha Cha Sushi. They have great food, great service, and are close to my house. My faourite dish to get is the lunch combo plate, in which you can choose up to 3 different items to eat. It even comes with a miso soup and a salad.</p>
