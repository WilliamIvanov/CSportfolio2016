        <p id="p1">&emsp;Hi, I'm Will and I'm a 15 year old sophomore who goes to Summit Rainier Public School. I was born in Faifax County Virginia. I lived in Wasington DC for most of my early childhood, except for fouth grade, when I went to live with my family in Romania for a year. There, I lived with my grandparents, aunt, and cousins. The next year, I came back to the U.S.. In 5th grade, my dad got a job offer in California, so we moved to San Jose. In 8th grade, I went to Romania for another year. I learned a lot of math so when I came back in 9th grade, I was placed in math II.<br> <img src="Kensonisthebest.png" width=500px></img> </br></p>
